## How it works
    this is a very simple project for now :)
    you need to place the file, you want to work with, in Data directory and name it “file.svg”
    before you do this, prepare your .svg file in your favourite graphic application
    1. do not use any stroke attributes - if you use stroke, convert them into the shape
    2. shapes should not overlap each other - if they do so, fix it
    3. when file is ready, save it to .svg

    keep in mind
    this program is in beta stadium, so for now its doesn't support colors - the final file will contain only the black shapes
    program default units is px
    export only to *.pdf
